I'm a Swedish IT-Admin/Dev, working in the Finance industry in Stockholm. I've got the most experience in .NET, mainly C#, but am expanding my horizons. I wish to learn more languages, code more and simply become more experienced within the development field.
Outside of coding I enjoy horseriding and gaming. I'm a huge animal person!
